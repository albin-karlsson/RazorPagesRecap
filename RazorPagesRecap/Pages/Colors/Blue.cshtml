<h1>Welcome to the Blue page!</h1>

<p>
    Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), 
    as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model.
    It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. 
    The term blue generally describes colors perceived by humans observing 
    light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 
    Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, 
    while ultramarine contains some violet.
    The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect 
    known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes.
    Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.
